# DESIGN-OF-UWB-MICROSTRIP-ANTENNA-FOR-WIRELESS-COMMUNICATION

## Introduction

This project proposes a novel design of a microstrip antenna optimized for operation in the 5G sub-band. The antenna has dimensions of (36 × 30 × 1.6) mm³ and is designed to operate efficiently with a specific substrate material. The effect of changing the substrate on the antenna's performance is thoroughly investigated. Two different substrates, Rogers 8850 with relative dielectric constant εr = 2.2 and loss tangent of 0.009, are studied in terms of their impact on return loss (S11), gain, and group delay.

## Antenna Design and Substrate Variation

- Antenna Size: (36 × 30 × 1.6) mm³
- Operating Band: 5G Sub-band

The microstrip antenna is installed using two different substrates with distinct relative dielectric constants:

1. Substrate 1: Rogers 8850 with εr = 2.2
2. Substrate 2: Rogers 8850 with εr = 6.15

## Performance Analysis

### Substrate 1 (εr = 2.2):

- Better Return Loss (S11)
- Improved Group Delay

### Substrate 2 (εr = 6.15):

- Better Gain

## Fabrication and Testing

The antennas are fabricated using Rogers 8850 substrates with a relative dielectric constant of εr = 2.2. The performance of the antennas is then tested using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA).

## Results

Both simulation and experimental results are obtained for the two different substrates, and it is found that they show reasonable agreement.

## Conclusion

The proposed microstrip antenna design offers an efficient solution for 5G sub-band communication. The choice of substrate significantly influences the antenna's performance in terms of return loss, gain, and group delay. Substrate 1 (εr = 2.2) provides better return loss and group delay, making it a suitable option for applications where these factors are critical. On the other hand, Substrate 2 (εr = 6.15) offers better gain, which might be preferred in scenarios prioritizing higher signal strength. The selection of the substrate should be based on the specific performance requirements of the intended application.

This project contributes valuable insights into the design and optimization of microstrip antennas for 5G communication, showcasing the importance of substrate selection in achieving desired performance characteristics. The findings can aid in the development of advanced antenna systems catering to diverse communication needs in the 5G era.
